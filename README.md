JPype
=====

From the [original Website](http://jpype.sourceforge.net/index.html):

    JPype is an effort to allow python programs full access to java class libraries.
    This is achieved not through re-implementing Python, as Jython/JPython has done,
    but rather through interfacing at the native level in both Virtual Machines.

This github fork applies changes to make the installation work on OSX,
as suggested by [Yuvul Adam](http://blog.y3xz.com/post/5037243230/installing-jpype-on-mac-os-x)
and the beautiful people in [one of the JPype Stackoverflow postings](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8525193/cannot-install-jpype-on-os-x-lion-to-use-with-neo4j).
